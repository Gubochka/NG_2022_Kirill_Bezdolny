Test flights are planned for 2026.\n\nAnd in other transport innovations, the XPeng flying car completed its first public test flight in Dubai in October. The all-electric, two-passenger vehicle takes off vertically without need for a runway and so is suited to built-up urban areas.\nDown at ground level, lightweight microcars might be the future of city driving, as countries around the world take steps to clear their streets of heavy traffic and pollution.",
